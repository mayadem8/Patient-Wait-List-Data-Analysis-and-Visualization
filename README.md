# Patient-Wait-List-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
This project involves the development of an interactive dashboard in Power BI to analyze and visualize patient waiting lists in a healthcare setting. The dashboard distinguishes between inpatient and outpatient cases, allowing stakeholders to track the current status of waiting lists and analyze historical trends from 2018 to 2021.
